# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms

I started this project with the aim of learning about data structures and algorithms, as well as learning how to use git.
I also plan to make a video game engine in the future in which I will include this library.

## Tests compilation example

```console
gcc -I include -o test/TestName test/TestName.cpp
```

## To-Do List

### Data Structures
- [X] Array
- [ ] Dynamic Array
- [ ] Vector
- [ ] Simply Linked List
- [ ] Doubly Linked List
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queue

### Allocators
- [X] Allocator Virtual Class
- [X] Default Allocator (new/delete based)
- [ ] Stack Allocator
- [ ] Block Allocator (pool)
- [ ] Scratch Allocator
- [ ] Linear Allocator (arena)
